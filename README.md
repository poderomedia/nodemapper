# NodeMapper
version 0.2.2

NodeMaper is a opinionated D3.js data visualization library that allows you to create and manage network visualizations in a simple way so you can use your time on customizing the library as you see fit, to deliver the end result you expect. NodeMapper provides the basic layer for visualizing the networks of entities you want to map (individuals and organizations, for example) from the information you have or collect. 
NodeMapper was originally conceived to display information corresponding to the 2014 Panama Elections Candidates for La Prensa newspaper, as part of the Poderopedia Data Mapper project. NodeMapper is a free open source software (see LICENSE) by Poderomedia Foundation (http://www.poderomedia.org), developed by Pablo Navarro and Gregorio Moreno from Masega Ltda. (http://www.masega.co). You can fork this project and deploy it with your own modifications. Please see the LICENSE file for details.

## Usage

NodeMapper was developed using  [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). The fullscreen functionality was implemented using Modal windows from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Overall design and craft by [Masega](http://www.masega.co). To create a network chart, you need to include the following:

- [D3.js]
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (for modal and fullscreen)
- `pty.js` and `pty.css`

The style of the visualization can be customized by modifying the pty.css file. See the [docs](http://poderopedia.github.io/panama-network/docs) for usage examples.
